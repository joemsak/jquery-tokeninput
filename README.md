**Not tested, could use some help to stabilize**

This fork is meant to work with [acts-as-taggable-on](https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on) and creates new tags if they aren't found.

**IT USES TAG NAMES not IDs** and should work with <%= f.text_field :tag_list %>

**I have found my changes to be slightly buggy at times...**
